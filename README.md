a literal static proxy that used service worker, ultraviolet and bare server.

what does that even mean?
it means you can host this on a static website hosting site like cloudflare pages and everything in the proxy would still work even tho you're using a static web hosting

but guess what
you still have to either host your own bare server or just get it from a proxy like artclass or doge unblocker
